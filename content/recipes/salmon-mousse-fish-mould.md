## GOOD FRIDAY COURTESY OF COOKERY IN COLOUR

It’s customary to eat fish on Good Friday. I never went to church but growing up we always ate fish on Good Friday. I now suspect it was my Mum’s excuse to eat seafood, rather than any fear of accidentally eating Jesus’ flesh.

I kept the tradition alive this year, using Good Friday as an excuse to throw a *Cookery in Colour* fish dinner party. 2019 is the year of Salmon Mousse.

## THE PROCESS

Marguerite gives us the choice of canned or fresh fish for this unique dish. I was doubtful that anyone was going to appreciate this meal either way—so I went with canned.

I didn’t really read the recipe before beginning (which really annoys Justin btw), so I was surprised to discover that true to its name, this recipe was actually a mousse. I was required to beat raw eggs, flour et. al. in the top of my improvised double boiler.

Basically, everything gets mixed together and poured into a fish mould. Not surprisingly, I see these moulds in thrift stores all the time.

I made my mould the night before to give it as much time as possible to set. It worked, but the chunkiness of the mixture meant it lacked a little finesse.

The most annoying part of this dish was the decoration. I followed Marguerite’s instructions exactly: “surround with green pea salad (cooked peas tossed in a French dressing) and garnish with wedges of hard-boiled egg, radish roses and stuffed olives”

Unfortunately, I left this until the last minute so Justin got stuck with some of these tasks.

Me: “Quick, help! I need you to whip up some radish roses”

Him: “Um… sure?”

We have no idea if he did it correctly, but the results were amazing.

## THE OUTCOME

First bites were shocking. The fish flavour was powerful and was unsettling when combined with the gelatinous texture. The general consensus was that the mousse was OK — once you got used to it.

I took one bite and declared, “I don’t like it!”, but with some encouragement, I carried on and found it to be edible.

Overall I would say this dish has something for everyone. Not every guest had the pleasure of eating the mousse — our youngest guest was just two, and I did not want to be responsible for putting him off seafood **for life**. He did, however, appreciate Justin’s radish roses which we found dunked in various drinks throughout the night.
