I was busy packing and prepping for a trip to my homeland, Australia, when I decided to make this one.

It was a miserable day in Vancouver and I thought a hot rice pudding after dinner would really hit the spot. With literally four ingredients in the recipe, it was also one I could easily manage in between hunting for travel adaptors, passports and my long-forgotten summer clothes.

It certainly has a fair share of haters, but I loved rice pudding as a child and was looking forward to this one!

## The Recipe

Like many rice pudding recipes, Marguerite’s is extremely easy. A large can of condensed milk, some water and some rice. Leave it alone in the oven and in a couple of hours you’ve got a tasty, hot dessert to eat.

But once my pudding was successfully baking away, I was suddenly struck by a few concerns with the recipe. It did seem like a lot of condensed milk... and while I confess to enjoying a few samples of the sweet stuff while preparing this recipe, one large can is a lot between four servings. Also, I wondered if the rice would really cook that way?

My initial taste at the two-hour mark confirmed my fears. The rice was hard and uncooked. After another 45 minutes of cooking time, not much had changed— except that by then condensed milk had burned.

## The Verdict

This recipe was completely inedible. Hard, uncooked rice clumped together in a sickly-sweet yellow goo, punctuated by bits of burnt condensed milk skin.

My boyfriend couldn’t eat it. I couldn’t eat it. A friend asked how I could mess up something as easy as rice pudding. I blamed the recipe.

I have to make a variation of this recipe in order to complete the book. The second time around I will definitely be doing this one differently!

Don’t make this at home! You have been warned.
