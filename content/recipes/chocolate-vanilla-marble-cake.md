## My First Attempt at a Vintage Cake

I have never really been into baking. I’ll sometimes dabble in banana cake, but otherwise, I can’t think of any cake I’ve ever made from scratch. In fact, I’m not really even into eating cakes that much.

My Cookery in Colour project has changed that. I’ve been excited about recreating some of the pretty desserts, so much so that I’ve forgotten that I don’t really know how to make one.

I figure all I need to do is follow the recipe right?

## The Process

I was lost on this cake from step one: “cream together the fat and sugar.” Excuse me, Marguerite, but I don’t see ‘fat’ listed in your list of recipe ingredients there? Do you mean butter, perhaps? I’m guessing that is it.

I’m sure these instructions made perfect sense to the homemaker of 1961, but it means nothing to me. Thank goodness for google and this article.

Beating eggs to add to my ‘creamed’ milk and sugar.

Once I got over my initial learning curve, it was all straight forward from there. I split my batter into two, making one chocolate and one vanilla.. it looked like it was going to work…

My final cake mix: set to go in its fluted mould.

Success! My cake actually looked like the book. And it smelled amazing too!

There is something strangely satisfying about the camo-style look of this.

The Outcome
My cake smelled and looked so good, and my friends were really eager to try it. But despite looking perfect, it tasted…. pretty ordinary. This cake was dry and bland – like eating some kind of crumbly old sponge. Everyone was very polite and said they enjoyed it, but after all our anticipation, it was a letdown.

I don’t know if I did something wrong (if you have any tips please let me know!), but this is one cake I won’t be trying again!

The finished slices looked professional!

## Ingredients

- 8 oz. flour ( with plain flour use 2 teaspoon baking powder)
- 1 heaped tablespoon cocoa or chocolate powder
- 6 oz. butter or margarine
- 6 oz. castor sugar
- 3 eggs
- few drops of vanilla essence

## Directions

1. Cream together the butter and sugar, until light and fluffy. Beat eggs and gradually add them to the mixture.
2. Divide mixture equally in two. Gently fold in 4 oz. flour sieved with the cocoa or chocolate powder to one. To the other half fold in the remaining flour and a few drops of vanilla essence.
3. Drop the mixtures, in alternating spoonfuls, into a well-greased, fluted cake mould or 7 inch round cake tin.
4. Bake in the centre of an oven at 375°F for 50 minutes. Cool, and dust with icing sugar before serving.
