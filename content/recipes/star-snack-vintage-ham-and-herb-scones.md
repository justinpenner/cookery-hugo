## VINTAGE SCONES FOR A GENDER REVEAL

I had promised a friend I would cook for a baby gender reveal picnic she was throwing. These days I get excited for any gathering that gives me a chance to complete a ‘Cookery in Colour’ recipe.

You would think an outdoor buffet for a gender themed party would be right up Marguerite Patten’s alley, but surprisingly, there was little in the book that was appropriate…or that I was comfortable serving publicly.

## THE RECIPE

‘Star Snack,’ aka decorative scones, were the winning dish for their simplicity and potential ability to hold up in the sun. The ingredients list for this dish were also pretty straightforward – flour, butter, ham & a dash of milk, herbs and salt.

![](vintage-scone-recipe-ingredients-star-snack.jpg "I minced the ham in the blender because I was lazy…")

The major hiccup in this recipe was when I asked the deli lady for 4 oz of ham (as per the recipe) and she aggressively told me that was a measurement for fluids. I then googled the conversion and held it up to her face so she could see. Take that!

The most annoying thing about this recipe was the decorating. I decided to do this the morning of the picnic, while also trying to do a million other things. Squeezing cream cheese through a piping bag and adding decorative parsley and tomato seemed like a very unnecessary waste of time for some scones.

## THE OUTCOME

The final product looked suspiciously ‘festive’ with all the bright red, white and green…. looking back at the original photo, I did spy some tinsel and mini-trees! Turns out this is actually a Christmas recipe they’ve tried to pass off as a ‘Television Snack.’

People seemed to like the scones, although I only thought they were OK. The recipe said “knead quickly,” but I may have taken this step to far, as I was informed the final product was a bit chewy by a friend who shall remain nameless.

And as for the outcome of the party itself?

It was a boy!
